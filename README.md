## 4. Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Authentication & Profiles

  Purpose: Secure signup/login with role-based access (guest/host)
  
  Contribution: Enables personalized experiences, protects sensitive actions (e.g., host-only listing creation), and builds trust through       verifiable profiles

### 2. Listing Management
  
  Purpose: Hosts create/edit property listings with photos, descriptions, pricing, and amenities
  
  Contribution: Forms the core inventory of rentable spaces, enabling detailed property discovery and informed guest decisions

### 3. Search & Filtering

Purpose: Location-based search with filters (dates, price, amenities, guests)

Contribution: Drives engagement by helping guests find ideal properties quickly, directly impacting booking conversions

### 4. Booking System

  Purpose: Date selection, price calculation, and reservation management with status tracking
  
  Contribution: Facilitates the core transaction flow, handles date conflicts, and automates cost calculations for seamless reservations

### 5. Reviews & Ratings

  Purpose: Post-stay reviews with ratings (1-5 stars) and comments tied to bookings
  
  Contribution: Builds credibility through authentic feedback, informs future guests, and incentivizes host quality improvements

### 6. Booking Calendar

  Purpose: Real-time visibility of property availability with blocking of booked dates

  Contribution: Prevents overbooking conflicts and provides instant availability status for both hosts and guests

## 5. API Security

Key Security Measures & Implementation

#### 1. Authentication
   
Implementation: JWT-based login with password hashing (bcrypt), OAuth2 for social logins, and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for critical actions.

Why Crucial: Protects against unauthorized account access, preventing impersonation, fraud, or data theft (e.g., stealing payment details).

#### 2. Authorization
   
Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC) with Django’s permission system (e.g., @user_passes_test decorators) and object-level checks (e.g., only hosts edit their listings).

Why Crucial: Ensures users access only their own data (e.g., guests can’t modify others’ bookings), safeguarding privacy and financial transactions.

#### 3. Rate Limiting
   
Implementation: API request throttling via Django REST Framework (e.g., 100 requests/minute) and tools like Redis to block brute-force attacks.

Why Crucial: Prevents denial-of-service (DoS) attacks and credential stuffing (e.g., flooding login pages), maintaining system stability.

#### 4. Data Encryption
   
Implementation: HTTPS/TLS for data in transit; AES-256 encryption for sensitive data at rest (e.g., payment details, messages); secrets management via AWS KMS or HashiCorp Vault.

Why Crucial: Shields user data (PII) and payment information from breaches, ensuring compliance with GDPR/PCI-DSS.

#### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
   
Implementation: Django form/model validation, parameterized queries to block SQL injection, and XSS prevention via template auto-escaping.

Why Crucial: Neutralizes injection attacks (e.g., malicious scripts in reviews) that could compromise databases or user sessions.
